To run on GNU/Linux:

first install Python and wxpython (if you already have Python 3.x installed this may
be a bit trickier than what I'm listing):

$ sudo apt-get install python2.7 python-wxtools

Download the zip file from github:

https://github.com/CJOlsen/perfect-meal/archive/master.zip
or 
click the "Download ZIP" button on https://github.com/CJOlsen/perfect-meal

then run perfectmeal_gui.py and it should work (you may need to add the wxpython
module to Python's "path" first)


Background/About:

The USDA maintains a huge dataset of foods and their nutrients, I was able to
find a JSON version of this data.  While a brute force search through the
data problem space to find a "perfect meal" (a combination of foods that meets a
full set of nutritional constraints) is NP-Hard, and a search to find *if*
a solution exists is NP-Complete, the problem can be approached through other
strategies - such as greedy algorithms and only searching a subset of the entire
database.  




The algorithm portion of this program is in ackpl.py and it's fully modular so it
can be used in other programs.  I haven't spun it off into its own repository yet
but I'm planning on it.
